# Evoked_Transmitted_Culture
Codes for running and fitted Evoked and Transmitted Culture models (see Hyafil and Baumard, 2002, Evoked and transmitted culture models: Using bayesian methods to infer the evolution of cultural traits in history. PLoS ONE 17(4): e0264509. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264509([https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0264509])).

The code is used in Study 4 of Baumard, N., Huillery, E., Hyafil, A. et al. The cultural evolution of love in literary history. Nat Hum Behav 6, 506â€“522 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01292-z

The code runs on matlab. It requires the GPML toolbox (http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/) for fitting ETC models with either the Laplace or EP appoximation (see details in original article). Make sure to a to add the directory to matlab path.
